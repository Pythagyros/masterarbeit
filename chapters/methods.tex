	\label{sub:streptomyces_sp_t}
		\emph{Streptomyces} sp. T\"u2401 was cultivated in a variety of complex media, which are listed in Table~\ref{tab:media_components}. Agar-plate cultures were grown on ISP2 medium at \SI{29}{\celsius}. \SI{100}{\micro\liter} of spore solution or liquid culture were used for inoculation. Liquid cultures were incubated at \SI{27}{\celsius} in shake flasks with aluminium caps. Pre-cultures were grown in \SI{20}{\milli\liter} of NL 410 in \SI{100}{\milli\liter} flasks and inoculated with plate-grown mycelium. Main cultures were grown in \SI{100}{\milli\liter} medium in \SI{500}{\milli\liter} flasks.

	\label{sub:fermentation}
	The strain T\"u2401 was cultivated at a ten-liter scale in a continuous stirred tank bioreactor. \SI{500}{\milli\liter} of pre-culture were grown in five \SI{500}{\milli\liter} round flasks containing \SI{100}{\milli\liter} of NL 410 medium without \ch{CaCO3}. The pre-cultures were inoculated from stored ISP-agar plates and grown for \SI{72}{\hour} at 27 \si{\celsius}. The pre-cultures were pooled and used to inoculate \SI{9.5}{\liter} of NL OM medium for fermentation. The temperature was kept at \SI{27}{\celsius} with an airflow of \SI{5}{\liter\per\minute} and a rotor speed of 200 rpm. Control samples of \SI{15}{\milli\liter} were taken throughout the process at regular intervals. Fermentation was stopped after \SI{125}{\hour} and the culture broth was harvested.

	The harvested fermentation broth was supplemented with diatomaceous earth and filtered through Pall T 1500 filter plates (relative retention range 10 - 30 µm). The remaining filter cake was discarded and the filtrate transferred to a stirring bucket % englischen begriff nachsehen
	Two liters of ethyl acetate were added to the filtrate and stirred for 30 min. After completed phase-separation, the organic phase was collected and the aqueous phase reused for further extraction. The process was repeated five times.

	\label{sub:thin_layer_chromatography}
	Thin layer Chromatography was performed with reverse extracts of T\"u2401 on TLC Silica Gel 60 F\textsubscript{254} plates by Merck.
	Aqueous samples were applied by pipetting \SI{1}{\micro\liter} at a time and letting the plate dry until the next application. The TLC chambers were filled up to \SI{1}{\centi\meter} with solvent and incubated for \SI{12}{\hour}. The plates were run until either 75 \% of the plate had been soaked or \SI{2}{\hour} had passed. The solvents used as mobile phases are listed in Table~\ref{tab:tlc_solvents}.

	The working orcin staining solution was prepared by mixing two storage solutions, solution A and B, at a ratio of 10:1 (v/v). Solution A contained 1 \% (w/v) \ch{Fe^{III}Cl} in 10 \% sulfuric acid, solution B contained 6 \% (w/v) Orcin in ethanol. The plates were sprayed with the working solution and treated with a heat gun for a few seconds.

	Preparative samples were obtained by scraping the silica off the unstained plate and collecting it in reaction tubes. The samples were then extracted with \SI{1}{\milli\liter} methanol, vortexed and sonicated for \SI{30}{\minute}. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for \SI{5}{\minute}, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and the extraction process repeated. The methanolic samples were dried at \SI{30}{\celsius} and resuspended in an amount of water equal to the sample initially applied on the TLC plate.
