	\label{sub:fermentation}
	The strain Tü2401 was cultivated at a ten-litre scale in a continuous stirred tank bioreactor. 500 ml of pre-culture were grown in five 500 ml round flasks containing 100 ml of NL 410 medium without \ch{CaCO3}. The pre-cultures were inoculated from stored ISP-agar plates and grown for 72 h at 27 °C. The pre-cultures were pooled and used to inoculate 9.5 l of NL OM medium for fermentation. The temperature was kept at 27 °C with an airflow of 5 l/min and a rotor speed of 200 rpm. Control samples of 15 ml were taken throughout the process at regular intervals. Fermentation was stopped after 125 h and the culture broth was harvested. Further processing is described in \ref{sub:processing_of_fermentation_broth}.

	The harvested fermentation broth was supplemented with diatomaceous earth and filtered through Pall T 1500 filter plates (relative retention range 10 - 30 µm). The remaining filter cake was discarded and the filtrate transferred to a stirring bucket % englischen begriff nachsehen
	Two liters of ethyl acetate were added to the filtrate and stirred for 30 min. After completed phase-separation, the organic phase was collected and the aqueous phase reused for further extraction. The process was repeated five times.
