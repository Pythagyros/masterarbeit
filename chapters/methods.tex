Each set of pH adjusted samples was then extracted with either ethyl acetate, methyl acetate or ethyl formate for \SI{30}{\minute}. The phases were separated by centrifuging at 4000~rpm for \SI{5}{\minute}. The organic phase was subtracted and stored in a new falcon tube. Samples of both phases were test for bioactivity against K12.

	The working orcin staining solution was prepared by mixing two storage solutions, solution A and B, at a ratio of 10:1 (v/v). Solution A contained 1 \% (w/v) \ch{Fe^{III}Cl} in 10 \% sulfuric acid, solution B contained 6 \% (w/v) Orcin in ethanol. The plates were sprayed with the working solution and treated with a heat gun for a few seconds.

	Preparative samples were obtained by scraping the silica off the unstained plate and collecting it in reaction tubes. The samples were then extracted with \SI{1}{\milli\liter} methanol, vortexed and sonicated for \SI{30}{\minute}. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for \SI{5}{\minute}, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and the extraction process repeated. The methanolic samples were dried at \SI{30}{\celsius} and resuspended in an amount of water equal to the sample initially applied on the TLC plate.

	Ion exchange chromatography was performed with both a strong anion (Diaion SA11A, 20-50 mesh, \ch{Cl-} form) and a strong cation exchange resin (Dowex 50WX4, 100-200 mesh, \ch{Na+} form). Three solutions were used for all operations: An acidic solution (1 \% (v/v) formic acid, pH 2), a neutral solution (MilliQ-\ch{H2O}, pH 7) and a basic solution (2 \% (v/v) ammonium hydroxide, pH 11).
	Prior to column preparation, both resins were swollen for \SI{24}{\hour}. The anion exchange resin (AnX) was swollen in the basic solution and the cation exchange resin (CatX) was swollen in the acidic solution. \SI{12.5}{\milli\meter} diameter glass columns were filled with resin up to a bed height of \SI{10}{\centi\meter} (AnX) or \SI{9.5}{\centi\meter} (CatX).
	Both columns were operated at a constant flow of \SI{2.5}{\milli\liter\per\minute}. All method steps are listed in Table~\ref{tab:ion_exchange_tab}. The pH of the applied sample was adjusted to pH 2 (CatX) or pH 11 (AnX) with \ch{NaOH} and \ch{HCl}. The flow-through of each step was collected and stored at \SI{4}{\celsius}.
