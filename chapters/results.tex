\section{Determination of Extraction Conditions} % (fold)
\label{sec:determination_of_extraction_conditions}

The strain Tü2401 was grown in seven different complex media for either four or seven days during preliminary experiments.
Culture broth supernatants of NL~200, NL~300, NL~500 and OM media displayed antibiotic activity against \coli  on plate assays.
A comparison between the viable production media and cultivation times is necessary to determine the optimal production medium for the following experiments.

Initial HPLC procedures failed to separate the active compound with standard reverse-phase screening methods. The compound displayed no retention on C-18 columns with acetonitrile/water gradients, making it likely to possess strong hydrophilic properties.
Additionally, the compound was not able to be extracted from the culture broth or biomass via ethyl acetate.
Its high solubility in water requires the development of an adapted extraction procedure to aid the purification process.

\subsection{Comparison of Production Media} % (fold)
\label{sub:comparison_of_production_media}

To determine the optimal production medium, Tü2401 was grown in each of the media for either four or seven days, in which the strain previously proved to be active.
The culture broth supernatants obtained were filtrated and subjected to the bioassay against \coli{}.
The assay results are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:medium_activity}.

    \textit{Escherichia coli}~K12. Media: (Top) NL~200 (Left) NL~300 (Right) NL~500 (Bottom) OM.}
	\label{fig:medium_activity}
\end{figure}

Most samples caused notable ($\varnothing>$\SI{1}{\centi\meter}) zones of inhibition in the agar diffusion assay.
NL~500 after seven days and OM in both cases produced the largest inhibition zones ($\varnothing > \SI{1.5}{\centi\meter}$).
Supernatant of NL~300 only produced inhibition zones after seven days of incubation.
OM medium produced the largest inhibition zone after only four days of cultivation and, thus, seems best suited to production of the hydrophilic compound.
NL~300 and 500 achieved maximum inhibition only after seven days, whereas NL~200 produced smaller inhibition zones in general.

NL~500 and OM supernatants were separated via an Agilent~1200 HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector (DAD) and evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD).
A C18 column was used in combination with a 4.5~\% to 100~ \% acetonitril screening gradient (see Table~\ref{tab:method_c18_screening}).
The chromatograms are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:results_medium_screen}.

	\label{fig:results_medium_screen}
\end{figure}

The screening chromatogram shows, that almost no UV- and ELSD-visible compounds in the OM broth supernatant were retained on the column.
The OM supernatant seems to predominantly contain polar, water-soluble compounds with very low affinity to the C-18 solid phase.
Since the antibiotic compound of interest also displayed no retention under similar conditions, the use of OM as a production medium would result in fewer impurities in the hydrophobic spectrum.
The visible antibacterial activity of the supernatant against \textit{E. coli}~K12 after only four days and the low amount of hydrophobic impurities led to the choice of OMas the default production medium for further experiments.

\subsection{Extraction experiments}
\label{sub:extraction_experiments}

One of the first steps in natural product isolation is usually the extraction via organic solvents to remove compounds of interest from a cellular matrix and enrich them in the solvent-phase.\autocite{Dragull2012,Sticher2008}
In the case of strain Tü2401, the culture broth supernatant is antibiotically active, whereas the biomass and extracts thereof are not.
The compound therefore seems to be readily excreted to the medium, eliminating the need to separate it from cellular matter.
However, and extraction process might still aid purification by removing hydrophilic contaminants such as salts easing further isolation steps such as HPLC.

A hydrophilic molecule is likely to contain functional groups like amines or carboxylic acids, which are charged at certain pH-ranges.
Adjusting the medium pH to reach the compounds point of zero charge could lower its water-solubility and, thus, enable extraction with an organic solvent.
Additionally, solvents with higher polarity while still being immiscible with water could be applied.

OM medium supernatant was split into three sets of five aliquots each.
Each aliquot was adjusted to either pH 2, 5, 7, 9 or 11.
Each set was extracted with one following solvents (listed by descending polarity $E_T (30)$):\autocite{Marcus1993}
Ethyl acetate, Methyl acetate and Ethyl formate.
Organic and aqueous phases were separated and tested for bioactivity against \coli{} via agar-diffusion assay.
The assay results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:results_extraction_bioassay}.

    }
	\label{fig:results_extraction_bioassay}
\end{figure}

Neither of the organic phases produced any inhibition zone, whereas all aqueous phases prodcued inhibition zones of similar size ($\varnothing > \SI{1.5}{\centi\meter}$).
The antibiotic compound could not be extracted with either ethyl acetate, methyl acetate or ethyl formate regardless of supernatant pH.
This could be due to a high amount of polar but uncharged groups or the compound being zwitterionic.
This would result in similar hydrophilicity over a wide pH range despite carrying no charge.
However, the compound could possess a point of lowered water-solubility, but with a very narrow pH range or at an extreme point.
The broad pH steps in the range of 2--14 covered in this experiment may have not hit this point.
A repetition of the experiment with pH steps of 1 or 0.5 and a wider range of 1 to 14 could be applied to further explore the existence of a zero-charge point, that enables organic extraction.

The similar size of inhibition zones across all tested pH values also implies a resistance to pH-dependent degradation of the active compound over the range of 2--11.
A notable trait of all inhibition zones caused by either pure broth supernatant or aqueous extraction phases is the the presence of resistant colonies within.
Since they grow seemingly random across the whole zone surface and not just the edges, concentration dependent resistance can be ruled out.
It is more likely, that a resistant subpopulation of \coli{} is present in the glycerol stocks used to inoculate the test strain.
The resistant subpopulation and the nonresistant strain must contain differences in antibiotic resistance genes.
Genome sequencing of both strains with subsequent comparison of resistance genes could test this hypothesis and lead to valuable insights to the mode of action.
From there on, classes of responsible compounds could be narrowed down and enable the development of more specialized isolation procedures.

Even though neither pH adjustment or change of solvent enabled extraction of the hydrophilic antibiotic, impurities in the hydrophobic spectrum are still removed by discarding the organic phase.
Following samples of OM culture broth supernatant were preprocessed by performing a reverse extraction with Methyl acetate, thus keeping the aqueous phase.

The \luna by Phenomenex features a silica matrix modified with 3-aminopropyl groups.
The used model had a particle size of \SI{3.5}{\micro\meter} and a pore size of 100~\AA.
The dimensions were $4.6\times250$~mm.

\subsubsection{Luna NH\textsubscript{2} Column}

Separation via the \luna column was performed with an isocratic method (see \ref{tab:method_nh2_standard}).
The mobile phase consisted of 80~\% acetonitrile and 20~\% water at a flow of \SI{2.0}{\milli\liter\per\minute}.
Both solvents contained 0.1~\% formic acid as a modifier.
\SI{50}{\micro\liter} of filtrated reverse extract at pH~11 were injected and fractions collected every minute.
The fractions were subjected to the standard agar-diffusion bioassay against \coli.
The chromatogram is shown in

% Bild im Anhang anfügen

With this method, the water-soluble compound could be separated from the injection peak.
Fractions 5, 6 and 7 produced noticeable zones of inhibition, correlating to elution between 4 and 7~min.
With the injection peak eluting at 1.5~min, a relative retention of 2.5 to 5.5 min could be achieved.
The majority seems to have eluted between 3.5 and 5.5~min, since the inhibition zones of fractions 6 and 7 were the largest with a diameter of \SI{1.7}{\centi\meter}.
Fraction 5 only produced a diameter of \SI{1.2}{\centi\meter}.
In the UV-chromatogram, two baseline-separated peaks with distinct spectra were detected in the timeframe correlated to bioactivity.
The first was detected at 5~min, the second at 6~min. The UV-spectra  indicate that two bioactive compounds with similar retention times have eluted right between the fraction collector timeframes.
A single compound should have resulted in the detection of a rather broad peak with long fronting.
However, if the compound does not possess a UV-chromophore, an additional method of detection is needed.

An evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) can be used to detect analytes without chromophores, as long as they are less volatile than the solvent.\autocite{Mathews2004,Righezza1988,Mourey1984,Charlesworth1978}
The detector can be coupled to a standard HPLC system and provides additional analytical data.
To eliminate elution differences between different systems, both the ELSD and the fraction collector were attached to the same system behind the UV-detector.
Since ELS-detection is inherently destructive, a splitter was used to divide the flow. One fifth was directed to the ELSD, the rest to the fraction collector.

\subsection{Ion Exchange Chromatography} % (fold)
\label{sub:results_ion_exchange_chromatography}

Water-soluble compounds contain polar functional groups, which in some cases can be protonated or deprotonated depending on the solvent pH.
A comparison of acid disassociation constants (\pka{}) of natural products in the Antibase2008 database revealed, that the majority of entries are likely to carry a charge at pH~2--11.\autocite{Mansson2010}
44~\% of compounds contained an acidic functionality, 17~\% a basic one, and 9~\% both.
The high prevalence of charged groups in natural products combined with the
hydrophilic nature of the antibiotic compound make the presence of basic or
acidic functionalities, such as amino- or carboxyl-groups, likely.
This can be utilized for purification purposes via ion-exchange chromatography (IEC).

Ion exchange chromatography (IEC) utilizes charged functional groups bound to an insoluble resin matrix.\autocite{Dragull2012}
Charged analytes are separated by the equilibrium between themselves and the counterions associated with the matrix.
Since the charge of natural products largely depends on pH and \pka, the choice of buffers, resins and counterions has
to be tailored to each experiment.
Through optimised conditions for stationary and mobile phase, selective ``catch and release'' purification methods can be designed.

IEC has a wide range of applications.
It is used in wastewater treatment and hydrometallurgy as well as to separate biological macromolecules like nucleic acids, carbohydrates and proteins.\autocite{Dragull2012,Alexandratos2009,Lee1996,Kenney1992}
It can also be used to separate small molecules and aid in their purification from complex sources.\autocite{Dragull2012,Hoffmann2009a,Katavic2007}
As of now the molecular properties of the antibiotic compound remain unclear, yet they may be approximated by its behaviour in separation techniques.
Exploration of the retention behaviour using IEC can be used to determine the presence of charged functional groups and approximate the \pka{}.

An explorative IEC method similar to the approach of M{\aa}nsson~\textit{et al.} was devised to test the the applicability of IEC for separation.\autocite{Mansson2010}
Two ion-exchange resins with orthogonal selective properties were employed to determine if the compound contains acidic or basic functionalities.
Both feature "strong" ion exchange groups, which retain their charge over a broad pH-range and are immobilized on divinylbenzene matrices.
The strong cation exchanger (SCX), Dowex 50WX4, contains negatively charged sulfonic acids, while the strong anion exchanger (SAX), Diaion SA11A, contains positively charged quarternary ammonium groups.
\SI{1}{\milli\liter} aliquots of filtrated culture broth supernatant were adjusted to either pH~2, to protonate acidic groups or pH~11 to deprotonate basic groups.
The sample at pH~2 was loaded onto the SCX whereas the pH~11 sample was loaded onto the SAX.
Washing steps at sample and neutral pH were performed to only ensure retention of compounds charged positively at pH~2 or negatively at pH~11.
Bound analytes were eluted by reversing the buffer pH from 2 to 11 and vice versa.
All loading, washing and elution fractions were collected, concentrated and subjected to the standard bioassay against \coli{}.

The first three out of five SAX elution fractions displayed antibiotic activity in the bioassay, whereas the loading and washing fractions did not.
The water-soluble compound was able to form an ionic bond with the sulfonic acid moieties of the SAX matrix at pH~11 and ph~7, but not at pH~2.
This indicates the presence of one or more functional groups with a \pka$<7$, which are most likely carboxyl groups.
As such, the compound might contain organic acid moieties.

None of the SCX fractions exhibited antibiotic activity in the bioassay.
The compound was not eluted prematurely due to low affinity, since the loading and washing fractions were inactive.
This could be due to an exceptionally strong bond of the compound to the cationic resin, which is still present at pH~11 and prevented elution with the used buffer.
A strongly basic alkaloid or amine with a \pka{}$>11$ for the protonated form would retain its charge and stay bound to the quarternary ammonium groups of the SCX.
Another possibility would be a reaction with the SCX matrix, either deactivating the compound or binding it irreversibly.
Since the presence of the compound was only inferred via bioactivity in the agar-diffusion assay, inactivation by prolonged exposure to high pH could have led to the negative assay results.
However, samples stored at \SI{8}{\celsius} and both high and low pH levels have retained antibioitc activity for several months without noticeable loss in produced inhibition zones.
pH dependent degradation is therfore not an issue for the compound in question.

Chromatographic screening of the active SAX elution fractions on a C-18 column (see Table~\ref{tab:method_c18_screening}) showed, that many impurities, especially in the hydrophobic spectrum, are still present.
Ion Exchange Chromatography with a strong cation exchange resin is able to be applied for the separation of the hydrophilic compound from filtered culture broth supernatant, but it needs to be refined to achieve higher purities.
Reverse extract samples can be used for separation instead of raw culture broth, to remove hydrophic compounds beforehand.
Variation of elution buffer pH might enable an elution profile more specific to the compound of interest and further narrow it's acid strength.

\subsection{Induction of the \textit{yorB} Reporter System} % (fold)
\label{sub:induction_of_the_yorb_reporter_system}

Preliminary screening of \emph{Streptomyces} strains on agar plates indicated strain Tü2401 to possess antibiotic activity against \emph{Bacillus subtilis} and \emph{Escherichia coli} strains.
Mode-of-action screening with the specialized \textit{Bacillus subtilis}~1S34~pHJS105-yorB-lacZ2 strain showed, that disks of agar-cultures are also able to induce the \emph{yorB} reporter system.

The \textit{yorB} gene from \textit{Bacillus subtilis} has been observed to be upregulated when cells were treated with quinolones.\autocite{Hutter2004a}
Construction of a luciferase reporter system led to the hypothesis, that induction is due to DNA damage caused by inhibition of the Topoisomerase~II alpha subunit.\autocite{Hutter2004}
Further characterization with greater natural product libraries strengthened this theory.\autocite{Mariner2011,Urban2007}
Table~\ref{tab:results_yorb_inducers} gives an overview of tested \textit{yorB}-inducing compounds, which either damage DNA directly or interfere with replication.

However, all samples and extracts stemming from liquid cultures were inactive in the \emph{yorB} assay.
The metabolite, which induced the \emph{yorB} reporter system, is likely not produced in shake-flask cultures with OM-medium.

Loss of activity when transitioning from solid to liquid cultures is a known phenomenon in \emph{Streptomyces} screening studies.\autocite{Pickup1993,SHOMURA1979}
Secondary metabolite production is regulated by a plethora of interacting factors, which are dependent on the developmental stage of the cell, nutrient availability and other internal and external factors.\autocite{Cihak2017,Jones2017,Gao2012,Bibb2005}
Cells grown in liquid cultures usually produce secondary metabolites during the stationary growth phase following nutrient depletion.\autocite{Bibb2005}
When grown on solid media, however, production coincides with the development of aerial hyphae.
Antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters have been observed to be influenced by the same regulators, which also govern morphological differentiation and spore development.\autocite{Ostash2011,DenHengst2010}

The compound, which is able to induce the \emph{yorB} reporter system of \emph{Bacillus subtilis} was likely not produced during growth in OM liquid, but in solid NL~200 solid medium.
Both media are nutrient rich and complex, which points to the formation of aerial hyphae as a stimulus for production.
Three cultivation strategies were developed to allow for both formation of air mycelium and extraction of the compound:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
	    Standing liquid cultures could allow the formation of aerial mycelium at the medium surface.
	    The compound could then be extracted from the fluid with standard procedures.
	    Two \SI{500}{\milli\liter} flasks were each filled with \SI{100}{\milli\liter} of liquid ISP2 medium and inoculated with \SI{1}{\milli\liter} of a one-week old NL~410 shake culture.
	    One flask was sealed with an ordinary aluminium cap (AC), the other one with an air-permeable foam cap (FC).
	    Both flasks were cultivated for four days, before the medium was centrifuged and the supernatant filtrated.
	    \SI{50}{\milli\liter} aliquots of each flask were extracted with either BuOH or EtAc, and both phases were collected seperately.
	    The organic phases were dried at \SI{40}{\celsius} and solved in \SI{1}{\milli\liter} MeOH.
	    Both phases of each flask were subjected to the yorB-Assay.
    \item
		Solid media cultivation on ISP2 agar proved to enable synthesis.
		Mincing of agar plates after cultivation could enable extraction with common solvents.
		Ten round ISP2 agar plates were inoculated with \SI{100}{\micro\liter} of a one-week old NL~410 shake culture and incubated for four days.
		One half of the plates was extracted with BuOH, the other half was extracted with EtAc.
    \item
        ISP2 agar plates could also be prepared with low-melting-point agarose (LMPA).
        Melting the agar prior to liquid extraction might lead to higher yields due to greater surface area.
        Using LMPA reduces the temperature and, thus, risk of thermal decomposition during the process.
        Six ISP2 LMPA agar plates were inoculated with \SI{100}{\micro\liter} of a week-old NL~410 shake culture and incubated for four days.
        The plates were then melted at \SI{70}{\celsius} and extracted with BuOH and EtAc.

All generated extracts and their respective aqueous phases were tested for bioactivity in agar diffusion assays.
The standard bioassay was used to determine the antibiotic activity against \textit{E. coli} K12 and \textit{B. subtilis} 168, while the \emph{yorB} assay tested antibacterial activity as well as reporter induction.
Additonally, agar stamps of ISP2 and ISP2 LMPA culture plates were tested in the yorB-Assay.

The bioassay results indicate a high variety of activity for the strain \tue{} depending on cultivation procedure.
Standing agar culture extracts were largely inactiva in the antibiotic and \emph{yorB}-assays.
Ethyl acetate extracts of the foam and aluminium cap cultures mark the only exception.
The foam cap extracts displayed high antibiotic activity against both \emph{B. subtilis} strains, whereas the aluminium cap extracts was lightly active against \textit{Bacillus subtilis} 1S34~pHJS105-yorB-lacZ2.
Strong antibiotic activity against \textit{Bacillus subtilis} 1S34~pHJS105-yorB-lacZ2 was also present in BuOH extracts of both agar plate cultures and the EtAc extracts of LMPA. 
Antibiotic assay results of agar plate cultures against \emph{B. subtilis}~168 were largely non-evaluable, yet ISP2-agar EtAc extract and the aqueous phase of the BuOH extraction tested positive.
Activity against \emph{E. coli} was only lightly present in the aqueous phase of ISP2 EtAc extract.

Antibiotic activity against \emph{B. subtilis} but not \emph{E. coli} in a range of organic extract samples hints at the presence of lipophilic compounds active against Gram-positive bacteria, but not Gram-negative.
Previous assays with organic extracts of liquid cultures further !!!
The non-evaluable results of the antibiotic assay against \emph{B. subtilis}~168 impede a comprehensive comparison of activity against both \emph{B. subtilis} strains and strengthen the need for further exploration of the activity spectrum of \tue{}.

The lack of activity against \emph{E. coli}~K12 for all but one sample indicates, that the putative hydrophilic compound present in liquid cultures is not produced in the same amount in standing liquid or agar cultures of ISP2 medium.
Testing of NL410 agar plate and standing cultures extracts has to be performed to determine whether the lack of activity is due to changes in medium or cultivation procedure.

The only samples able to induce the the \emph{yorB} reporter system were the ISP2 agar plaque and the aqueous phase of its EtAc extract.
The plaque confirms the ability of strain Tü2401 to induce the reporter when grown on this particular solid medium, whereas aqueous extract sample indicates the active component(s) to be soluble in water, but not EtAc.
The lack of activity in the aquous BuOH extraction sample could be due to an inactivating reaction with BuOH during the extraction procedure.
However, the activity of the aquous EtAc extract was distinctly smaller than that of the agar plaque despite it being generated from multiple agar plates.
The loss of activity could therefore also stem from low solubility or degradation during processing regardless of solvent.
Variations in biomass used for the BuOH extracts could have resulted in an active-compound concentration below the detection threshhold.
LMPA extracts and samples were entirely inactive in the \emph{yorB}-assay, indicating that the type of agarose also plays a role in determining production of the putative \emph{yorB}-inducer.

The combined \emph{yorB}- and antibacterial bioassays for different cultivation techniques largely did not lead to extraction of the \emph{yorB}-inducing compound.
Only the aquous EtAc extract of ISP2 agar plates displayed minor activity.
The inactivity of standing culture and LMPA extracts and samples shows that the \emph{yorB}-inducing compound might only synthesized under specific growth conditions, indicating high regulation of the underlying cluster.
As of now, the compound is only produced when grown on ISP2 agar plates and is not readily extracted from ground-up plates with organic solvents.
Since the conditions which determine production are not yet determined, a wider array of media and culture techniques could be employed to narrow down the necessary stimuli.
Especially minimal media or media with single limited nutrients could be used to explore if production is only dependent on sporulation or also on nutrient availability.
An optimal production medium designed with this knowledge might be able to circumvent agar plate extraction, which in this assay proved to be insufficient in achieving significant concentrations of active compound.
However, the assay highlighted the potential of a third compound, which is soluble in EtAc and BuOH and active against \emph{B.~subtilis} but not \emph{E.~coli}.
Since this compound seems to be produced in liquid culture and be readily extracted, isolation and structure elucidation could be achieved far more swiftly.
Overall, \tue{} displays a remarkable diversity in biologically active secondary metabolites, which all require different environmental stimuli.

\subsection{Phylogeny of Strain Tü2401} % (fold)
\label{sub:phylogeny_of_strain_tue2401}

Basic local-alignment search tool (BLAST) queries for the 16S-rRNA sequence of strain Tü2401 against the NCBI database revealed a variety of \emph{Streptomyces} sequences with very high (>99~\%) identity.
16S-sequence identity confirms the strain as a member of the genus \emph{Streptomyces}, but is insufficient to define the species.
To achieve this, 50 single-copy household genes were identified in the Tü2401- and 50 reference genomes of other fully sequenced \emph{Streptomyces} strains.
The multiple sequence alignments of these genes were used to construct the  maximum-likelihood tree shown in Figure~\ref{fig:phylo_tree}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tu2401_tree}
	\caption[Maximum likelihood tree of \emph{Streptomyces} sp. Tü2401.]{%
		\textbf{Maximum likelihood tree of \emph{Streptomyces} sp. Tü2401.}

	\label{fig:phylo_tree}
\end{figure}

The closest relative to Tü2401 among the reference strains is \emph{Streptomyces~mediolani}~NRRL~WC-3934.
The first members of this species were isolated 1969 in Milan and investigated for carotenoid production, yet publications regarding secondary metabolites are sparse.\autocite{Arcamone1969,Bianchi1970}
(--)-8-\emph{O}-methyltetrangomycin is mentioned to be synthesized by \emph{S.~mediolani}~AC37, which is an angucycline with antibiotic activity against \emph{Listeria~monocytogenes} and cytotoxic properties.\autocite{Maruna2010,Jimenez2012}
AntiSMASH analysis of strain Tü2401(see Section~\ref{sub:antismash_cluster_identification}) did not indicate the presence of angucycline biosynthetic gene clusters.

The multiple sequence alignment and tree construction establish the strain Tü2401 as a member of the genus \emph{Streptomyces} and a close relative of \emph{S.~mediolani}~NBRC15427.

\subsection{AntiSMASH Cluster Identification} % (fold)
\label{sub:antismash_cluster_identification}

%isorenieratene cluster found --> isolate from first description of mediolani

All five contigs were submitted to the antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis SHell (antiSMASH) to identify known biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).\autocite{Weber2015,Blin2013,Medema2011}
75 clusters were identified across the genome, seven out of which were $\geq 95 \%$ similar to characterized clusters.

\subsubsection*{Contig 1}

Two clusters with 100~\% gene identity to characterized BGCs were identified on this contig.
The first is a Type1-PKS-NRPS hybrid and contains genes identical to a SGR~PTMs BGC (\textsf{BGC0001043}), a Frontalamide BGC (\textsf{BGC0000996}) and a Heat-Stable Antifungal Factor BGC (\textsf{BGC0000999}).\autocite{Luo2013,Blodgett2010,Yu2007}
The three clusters are associated with production of polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PTMs), a diverse class of compounds with a wide range of biological activites.\autocite{Schobert2008}
Frontalamide A/B and the Heat-Stable Antifungal Factor (HSAF) displayed antifungal bioactivity; a mode of action commonly observed in bacterial PTMs.\autocite{Blodgett2010,Yu2007,Graupner,JAKOBI1996,Schobert2008}
PTM gene clusters are highly conserved and present in over 50~\% of sequenced \emph{Streptomyces} species but also appear across a wide range of phylogenetically diverse bacteria.\autocite{Blodgett2010}
Figure~\ref{fig:known_ptms} displays the structures of select bacterial PTMs.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

	\textbf{Structures of bacterial polycyclic tetramate macrolactams.} Adapted from Blodgett \emph{et al.} (2010). Copyright lies with the respective authors.}
\label{fig:known_ptms}
\end{figure}

The other cluster is predicted to be a lantipeptide BGC with genes identical to the AmfS BGC (\textsf{ BGC0000496}).
The \emph{amf} gene cluster was studied in \emph{S.~griseus} and is involved in the formation of aerial mycelium.\autocite{Ueda2002a}
The AmfS peptide is postulated to be an extracellular morphogen and not directly associated with antibiotic activity.

The presence of a putative PTM biosynthetic gene cluster in the genome of \tue{} indicates a potential to synthesize antifungal compounds.
Antifungal bioactivity assays can be employed to test culture supernatant and agar-disks.
The associated Frontalamide A/B and HSAF were reported to be active against plant pathogens \emph{Bipolaris~sorokiniana}, \emph{Fusarium~graminearum}, \emph{F.~verticilloides} and \emph{Ophiostoma~minus}.\autocite{Blodgett2010,Yu2007}
Isolation of a new variety or efficient production of PTM compounds could prove strain Tü2401 as a promising source of antifungal compounds.


\subsubsection*{Contig 2}

Contig~2 contains three clusters with 100~\% identity to characterized genes.
The first one is highly similar to an isorenieratene biosynthetic gene cluster from \emph{Streptomyces griseus} (MIBiG BGC-ID: \textsf{BGC0000664}).
Isorenieratene is a rare carotene which is synthesized by green photosynthetic bacteria and few actinomycetes.\autocite{Krugel1999}
Carotenes mainly serve as protectants against oxidative stress and are unlikely to possess antibiotic activites.\autocite{Olson1995}
Additionally, the orange coloration of carotenogenic strains has not been observed during growth of strain Tü2401.
The gene cluster is likely not actively expressed under the used growth conditions.
The two other clusters on this contig are highly similar to a griseobactin BGC (\textsf{BGC0000368}) from \emph{Streptomyces}~sp. ATCC~700974 and an ectoine BGC from \emph{Halomonas elongata}.
The former compound is an unusual siderophore from streptomycetes, the latter serves as an osmoprotectant.\autocite{Patzer2010,Prabhu2004}
Both are not associated with antibiotic activity.

\subsubsection*{Contig 3}

Only one cluster with high similarity to known BCG's was identified on Contig~3.
Its genes are 100~\% identical to the Desferrioxamine~B BGC from \emph{Streptomyces~griseus} (\textsf{BGC0000941}).\autocite{Ohnishi2008}
Desferrioxamine~B, like griseobactin, is a siderophore necessary to facilitate iron uptake.\autocite{H.2006}

\subsubsection*{Contig 4}

One cluster was detected on contig four and identified as a Type1-PKS-NRPS hybrid.
It shows a 95~\% cluster identity to the C-1027 biosynthetic gene cluster from \textit{Streptomyces} globisporus C-1027 (\textsf{BGC0000965}). Additionally, three homologous subclusters with 100~\% identity were identified, which are associated with the synthesis of C-1027, Neocarzinostatin and Maduropeptin enediynes (see Figure \ref{fig:cluster_search}).
The presence of this cluster could indicate, that the strain Tü2401 is capable of producing a compound similar to enediyne antibiotics.

Enediyne natural products are a class of cytotoxic bacterial compounds, which cause extensive DNA-damage.\autocite{Liang2010,Gredicak2007,AdrianL.Smith*1996,Nicolaou1993}
11 different enediyne natural products are known, all of which feature either a bicyclo[7.3.0]dodecadienediyne core inside a nine-membered ring or a bicyclo[7.3.1]tridecadiynene core inside a ten-membered ring (Figure \ref{fig:enediyne_comparison}).
The 9-membered family includes neocarzinostatin, C-1027 and and maduropeptin.
The 10-membered family includes calicheamicin~$\gamma_{1}^{I}$, esperamicin A\textsubscript{1} and dynemicin A.\autocite{Liang2010}
Enediynes are potent cytotoxic agents because of their ability to induce DNA double-strand breaks.\autocite{Shen2015}
lectronic rearrangement of the carbocycle produces a benzenoid diradical, which abstracts hydrogen atoms from the DNA-backbone.
he consulting radicals cause interstrand crosslinks or react with molecular oxygen.

	\label{fig:enediyne_comparison}
\end{figure}
While the ten-membered enediyne compounds were isolated as free-standing chromophores, most of the compounds in the nine-membered family were isolated in conjunction with a protective apoprotein.\autocite{Liang2010}
The nine-membered chromophore of C-1027, which was isolated from \textit{Streptomyces} globisporus C-1027, is bound noncovalently to an 110 amino acid apoprotein.\autocite{AdrianL.Smith*1996,Minami1993,Yoshida1993,Otani1993,Sugiura1993,Matsumoto1993,Otani1991,Otani1988a,Matsumoto1993a}
The isolated chromophore has been shown to be very unstable, whereas the holo C-1027 did not lose activity under the same conditions.\autocite{Matsumoto1993,Sugiura1993,Otani1991}
The apoprotein binds specifically to the C-1027 chromophore, supposedly via hydrophic pocket, which binds the benzoxazine side chain.\autocite{Okuno1994,Matsumoto1993}
The enediyne antibiotics neocarzinostatin and maduropeptin, which were also isolated from actinomycetes, feature highly specific and protective apoproteins as well.\autocite{AdrianL.Smith*1996}

The homologies of the identified cluster could be an indicator, that the strain Tü2401 is capable of synthesizing an enediyene antibiotic with a nine-membered core and a corresponding apoprotein.
The potent DNA-strand-breaking capabilities of this compound-class could induce the \textit{yorB} reporter system of \textit{Bacillus subtilis} 1S34 pHJS105-yorB-lacZ2 in the yorB-induction assay.
A number of compounds, which cause DNA double strand breaks and crosslinks are reported to induce the system, though none of them belong to the family of endiyne antibiotics.\autocite{Urban2007}
Whether this is due to inactivity or lack of representation in the assay is unclear, since the compound library is not publicly accessible.
Nevertheless, the mode of action of enediyne compounds matches positive compounds closely.

Section~\ref{sub:yorb_reporter_gene_assay} discussed, that the \textit{yorB} inducing compound is produced when the strain is grown on an ISP2 agar plate, but not in liquid culture.
Solvent extracts of plate cultures were also largely inactive with only minimal activity being present in the aqueous phase of ethyl acetate extraction.
Maximum activity could only be observed in unprocessed plate culture samples.
The apoprotein could have been detached during the extraction and concentration process, which also included high temperatures of \SIrange[range-units=single]{40}{60}{\celsius}.
Combined with incubation times of up to several days between extraction and assay, this could have led to the degradation of the chromophore below the sensitivity threshhold.
The high temperatures and long storage times also apply to the numerous HPLC-fractioning samples subjected to the \textit{yorB}-induction assay.

To verify this assumption, the putative endiyne compound has to be extracted by an adapted protocol, dereplicated and subjected to the assay in pure form.
The C-1027 antibiotic protein from \textit{S. globisporus} was precipitated from the medium supernatant by the addition of ammonium sulfate and purified by dialysis and column chromatography.\autocite{Otani1988a}
The active chromophore could be extracted from the apoprotein with methanol at \SI{0}{\celsius}.\autocite{Matsumoto1993}
However, as of now, untreated medium supernatant samples of the strain Tü2401 did not induce the \textit{yorB}-reporter system.
The cultivation in liquid OM medium is probably not sufficient for production of the putative endiyene compound and the protocol would have to be adapted for the extraction from ISP2 agar plates.
To circumvent this, other cultivation media could be employed and tested for \textit{yorB}-induction.
The holo endiyne-apoprotein complex should be stable enough for routine testing of culture broth and its supernatant.
The only alternative to optimizing production conditions would be heterologous expression of the biosynthetic cluster.
For the endiyne compound family though, this has, as of now, only been partly achieved for the nine-membered endiyne neocarzinostatin.\autocite{Zhang2008}

Only eleven compounds of the enediyne family are known to this date, yet several members are in use or development as anticancer drugs with promising results.\autocite{Liang2010,Galm2005}
Isolation of a new endiyne compound could hold a strong promise for the discovery of a new anticancer drug lead structure, which makes strain Tü2401 a valuable target for further investigation.

\section{Fermentation of \tue{}} % (fold)
\label{sec:fermentation_of_tue}

During the course of the thesis, \tue{} has been cultivated in 50--500~ml shake flasks without baffles.
Culture volumes from 10 to 100~ml could be reached with this approach, leading to roughly 21~mg/ml biomass and 2~mg/ml reverse extract (see Section XXX).
This yields of about 200~mg reverse extract per 500~ml flask, of which the content of antibiotic could be very small.
Great amounts of extract, which are necessary for further purification and structure elucidation, are very labor intensive to achieve this way.
This problem could be solved by cultivating of \tue{} at a greater scale, providing a larger amount of biomass in a labor-efficient manner.
Additionally, fermentation would further investigate the growth conditions, under which the active antibiotic is produced.
These can vary heavily between shake flasks and stirred bioreactors, especially in regard to oxygen levels and perturbation.\autocite{Buchs2001}

The strain was fermented in OM medium at a \SI{10}{\liter} scale in a continuous stirred tank bioreactor.
The temperature was kept at \SI{27}{\celsius} with \SI{5}{\liter\per\minute} of airflow.
Samples were drawn every \SI{24}{\hour} and the culture broth supernatant subjected to the standard antibiotic assay against \coli{}.
The pH only decreased marginally throughout fermentation, decreasing from the initial 6.4 to the final 6.0.
After \SI{125}{\hour} the peak diameter of inhibition zone on agar plates had been observed and the culture was harvested.
Cells and insoluble matter were removed by filtration, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate.
Both phases were collected and concentrated by evaporation and lyophilization.
The processing steps and final yields are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ferm_process}.
The filtrate and extraction phases were subjected to the antibiotic assay against \coli{} and \bac{}.
Both the filtrate and aqueous phase were active against \emph{E. coli} and \emph{B. subtilis} with inhibition zones comparable to samples from shake flasks.
The organic phase was inactive.

The experiment demonstrated, that \tue{} is not only able to be cultivated in stirred bioreactors at a \SI{10}{\liter} scale, but is also able to synthesize the hydrophilic antibiotic under these conditions.
This enables larger cultivation scales to obtain greater amounts of the active compound for purification and structure determination.
When combined with sufficient quantization methods for the active compound, further optimization of culture conditions can be performed to maximize yields.
The filtrate and extracts still need to be subjected to the \emph{yorB}-assay to determine, wether the putative DNA-binding compound is synthesized in this setup.
