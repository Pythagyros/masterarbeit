# Regulation of secondary metabolism in Streptomyces

## Claims

* Cihak et al. 2017
    - Subsequent development of aerial hyphae is considered to be a cell response to nutrient depletion; most of the secondary metabolites are formed at this developmental stage (cites Seipke et al 2012 and Sello & Buttner 2008)
* Sello & Buttner 2008
    - When grown in shaken liquid cultures, streptomycetes often begin to produce antibiotics during the transition from exponential to stationary phase (cites Bibb 2005)

* Jones & Elliot 2017
    - Aerial hypha formation requires the activity of the bld genes, whose products are primarily regulators that direct the production of aerial hypha-specific proteins and, in some cases activate specialized metabolism (cites Hengst et al. 2010)

## Short summaries

* Bibb 2005
    - General theme in sec. metabolism activation is nutrient depletion -> growth rate reduction / growth cessation
    - y-Butyrolactone-binding proteins often act as transcriptional repressors 
        + indicates induction by quorum sensing mechanisms
    - In liquid cultures, sec metabolite production occurs in stationary phase
        + likely due to nutrient depletion
    - In agar grown cultures, production happens around formation of aerial hyphae

* Sello & Buttner 2008
    - RNAse III is needed to produce calcium dependent antibiotic and develop proper sporulation septa in *S. coelicolor*
    - Does not really back Cihak's claim for secmet. production, just cites Bibb 2005 in introduction
