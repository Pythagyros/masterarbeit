# Enediyenes

## Observations

* 1 BGC identified as type 1 pks / nrps on contig 4
* 100 % subcluster identity to C-1027, neocarzinostatin and maduropeptin enediyne
* 95 % cluster identity C-1027 biosynthetic gene cluster

## General

* Enediyenes consist of three components
    - Delivery system
    - DNA damaging component
    - trigger to initiate reactions

## C1027 Chromophore

Hu(1988)
* First discovery of C-1027

Yoshida(1993) - Structure elucidation
* structure elucidation of purified chromophore
* highly sensitive to light, basic agents, thiol compounds
* even degrades in acidic, aqueous solutions within a day

Xu(1994) - Mode of action
* C1027 causes DNA damage by double- and single-strand breaks, as well as abasic sites
