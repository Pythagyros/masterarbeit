## [Ritter & Wong 2001](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/1521-3773%2820011001%2940%3A19%3C3508%3A%3AAID-ANIE3508%3E3.0.CO%3B2-I)

* Carbohydrate antibiotics
    - Based on carbohydrates
        + Contain a glycan portion
        + target enzyme/receptor associated with carbohydrate synthesis/metabolism/recognition
    - Problems
        + High amount of similarly reactive hydroxy groups -> synthetic difficulties
        + Often bind targets with low affinity
        + Too hydrophilic and complex for medicinal chemists
