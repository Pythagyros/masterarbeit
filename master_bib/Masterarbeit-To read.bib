abstract = {This paper presents a general overview of the application of hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) in the analysis of antibiotics in different sample matrices including pharmaceutical, plasma, serum, fermentation broths, environmental water, animal origin, plant origin, etc. Specific applications of HILIC for analysis of aminoglycosides, ??-lactams, tetracyclines and other antibiotics are reviewed. HILIC can be used as a valuable alternative LC mode for separating small polar compounds. Polar samples usually show good solubility in the mobile phase containing some water used in HILIC, which overcomes the drawbacks of the poor solubility often encountered in normal phase LC. HILIC is suitable for analyzing compounds in complex systems that elute near the void in reversed-phase chromatography. Ion-pair reagents are not required in HILIC which makes it convenient to couple with MS hence its increased popularity in recent years. In this review, the retention mechanism in HILIC is briefly discussed and a list of important applications is provided including main experimental conditions and a brief summary of the results. The references provide a comprehensive overview and insight into the application of HILIC in antibiotics analysis. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
