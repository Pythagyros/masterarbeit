abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Fructose, glucose, and sucrose were identified and quantified in commercial samples of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Lycium barbarum{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} L. fruits (goji berries) by high performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD) method. This study described a rapid, simple, sensitive, selective, and reliable HPLC method suitable for the profiling of major sugars in berries, the evaluation of the nutritional/energetic properties, and assessment of the maturation stage. The proposed analytical method was validated and the results showed good precision, accuracy, and linearity. In all analyzed goji fruits, glucose and fructose were the predominant sugars, while sucrose content was about ten times lower than each monose. It was observed that glucose and fructose were detected in comparable quantities in all considered samples. Quantitative analysis showed that fructose, glucose, and sucrose content ranged from 154.20 to 259.13 mg g {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} , from 152.92 to 284.60 mg g {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} , and from 13.75 to 36.43 mg g {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} , respectively. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
