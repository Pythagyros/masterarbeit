abstract = {The amf gene cluster was previously identified as a regulator for the onset of aerial-mycelium formation in Streptomyces griseus. The nucleotide sequences of amf and its counterparts in other species revealed a conserved gene organization consisting of five open reading frames. A nonsense mutation in amfS, encoding a 43-amino-acid peptide, caused significant blocking of aerial-mycelium formation and streptomycin production, suggesting its role as a regulatory molecule. Extracellular-complementation tests for the aerial-mycelium-deficient phenotype of the amfS mutant demonstrated that AmfS was secreted by the wild-type strain. A null mutation in amfBA, encoding HlyB-like membrane translocators, abolished the extracellular AmfS activity without affecting the wild-type morphology, which suggests that AmfBA is involved not in production but in export of AmfS. A synthetic C-terminal octapeptide partially induced aerial-mycelium formation in the amfS mutant, which suggests that an AmfS derivative, but not AmfS itself, serves as an extracellular morphogen. },

abstract = {In a recent project, we collected the transcriptional profiles of Bacillus subtilis 168 after treatment with a large set of diverse antibacterial agents. One result of the data analysis was the identification of marker genes that are indicative of certain compounds or compound classes. We cloned these promoter regions in front of a luciferase reporter gene and reintroduced the constructs individually into the B. subtilis chromosome. Strains were analyzed for their responsiveness after treatment with a set of 37 antibacterials. Twelve functional reporter strains were generated that were selectively and significantly upregulated by the compounds. The selectivity of the reporter strains ranged from generic pathways like protein biosynthesis, cell wall biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis to compound classes (quinolones and glycopeptides) and individual compounds (rifampin, cycloserine, and clindamycin). Five of the strains are amenable for high-throughput applications, e.g., pathway-specific screening. In summary, we successfully generated B. subtilis reporter strains that are indicative of the mechanisms of action of various classes of antibacterials. The set of reporter strains presented herein can be used for mode-of-action analyses and for whole-cell screening of compound libraries in a mode-of-action-specific manner.},

abstract = {Abstract The effects of the nature of the solvent and solutes on the response of an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) are discussed. Data have been measured for six solutes with seven different solvents using concentric and cross-flow nebulizers. The experimental results suggest that the influence of the solvent on the properties of a dried aerosol are not properly accounted for by the equation of Nukiyama and Tanassawa. A modification of the droplet size distribution of the aerosol takes place, probably during the vaporization of the solvent. The amount of scattered light depends strongly on the molar absortivity of the solute at the light beam wavelength. Accordingly, the detector response depends on the properties of the solvent and the solute. The ELSD is not a mass detector and calibration is required for quantitative analysis.},

abstract = {Retention characteristics of four polar stationary phases (i.e., amide, amino, silica and sulfobetaine) were studied by using a group of small polar compounds in hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC). Different polar stationary phases shared certain degrees of similarity, but also exhibited differences in retentivity and selectivity for the model compounds. Among the four columns studied, HILIC Silica column had the least retention for the model compounds, but also showed different selectivity from other three columns. Experimental data also provided some evidences that functional groups on the stationary phases might have certain degrees of influence on selectivity possibly through secondary interactions with the model compounds. The retention of the acids on the amino phase decreased with increasing salt concentration in the mobile phase due to the ion-exchange effect, and the retention process was endothermic as opposed to exothermic on other phases. This study also systematically investigated the effect of various experimental factors on the retention of the polar stationary phases, such as acetonitrile content, column temperature, buffer pH, salt type and concentration in the mobile phase. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Genome-mining efforts revealed strikingly conserved frontalamide-like biosynthetic clusters in the genomes of phylogenetically diverse bacteria ranging from proteobacteria to actinomycetes. Screens for environmental actinomycete isolates carrying frontalamide-like biosynthetic loci led to the isolation of a number of positive strains, the majority of which produced candidate frontalamide-like compounds under suitable growth conditions. These results establish the prevalence of frontalamide-like gene clusters in diverse bacterial types, with medicinally important Streptomyces species being particularly enriched.},

abstract = {Most small molecules are unable to rapidly traverse the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and accumulate inside these cells, making the discovery of much-needed drugs against these pathogens challenging. Current understanding of the physicochemical properties that dictate small-molecule accumulation in Gram-negative bacteria is largely based on retrospective analyses of antibacterial agents, which suggest that polarity and molecular weight are key factors. Here we assess the ability of over 180 diverse compounds to accumulate in Escherichia coli. Computational analysis of the results reveals major differences from the retrospective studies, namely that the small molecules that are most likely to accumulate contain an amine, are amphiphilic and rigid, and have low globularity. These guidelines were then applied to convert deoxynybomycin, a natural product that is active only against Gram-positive organisms, into an antibiotic with activity against a diverse panel of multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We anticipate that these findings will aid in the discovery and development of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria.},

@article{Patzer2010,
abstract = {The main siderophores produced by streptomycetes are desferrioxamines. Here we show that Streptomyces sp. ATCC 700974 and several Streptomyces griseus strains, in addition, synthesize a hitherto unknown siderophore with a catechol-peptide structure, named griseobactin. The production is repressed by iron. We sequenced a 26-kb DNA region comprising a siderophore biosynthetic gene cluster encoding proteins similar to DhbABCEFG, which are involved in the biosynthesis of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHBA) and in the incorporation of DHBA into siderophores via a nonribosomal peptide synthetase. Adjacent to the biosynthesis genes are genes that encode proteins for the secretion, uptake, and degradation of siderophores. To correlate the gene cluster with griseobactin synthesis, the dhb genes in ATCC 700974 were disrupted. The resulting mutants no longer synthesized DHBA and griseobactin; production of both was restored by complementation with the dhb genes. Heterologous expression of the dhb genes or of the entire griseobactin biosynthesis gene cluster in the catechol-negative strain Streptomyces lividans TK23 resulted in the synthesis and secretion of DHBA or griseobactin, respectively, suggesting that these genes are sufficient for DHBA and griseobactin biosynthesis. Griseobactin was purified and characterized; its structure is consistent with a cyclic and, to a lesser extent, linear form of the trimeric ester of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-arginyl-threonine complexed with aluminum under iron-limiting conditions. This is the first report identifying the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of DHBA and a catechol siderophore in Streptomyces. },

No such mixed iterative PKS-NRPS enzymes have been characterized in bacteria. Genome-mining efforts revealed strikingly conserved frontalamide-like biosynthetic clusters in the genomes of phylogenetically diverse bacteria ranging from proteobacteria to actinomycetes. Screens for environmental actinomycete isolates carrying frontalamide-like biosynthetic loci led to the isolation of a number of positive strains, the majority of which produced candidate frontalamide-like compounds under suitable growth conditions. These results establish the prevalence of frontalamide-like gene clusters in diverse bacterial types, with medicinally important Streptomyces species being particularly enriched.},

The most widely used method at present is the paper-disk sensitivity test. The more cumbersome tube-dilution technique is valuable in special instances in which bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic end-points are needed. Other procedures, such as the plate-dilution, agarwell-diffusion, or ditch-diffusion technique, are more difficult, offer no advantages for routine use, and have been more or less abandoned. In spite of its widespread use there exists considerable variability in the performance of the disk technique, leading to a large number of confusing reports in the literature. There are two methods of performing and interpreting the test. In the first, two or three disks containing different concentrations are used for each antibiotic. The presence or absence of a},

abstract = {The widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in a growing problem of antimicrobial resistance in the community and hospital settings. Antimicrobial classes for which resistance has become a major problem include the ?-lactams, the glycopeptides, and the fluoroquinolones. In gram-positive bacteria, ?-lactam resistance most commonly results from expression of intrinsic low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins. In gram-negative bacteria, expression of acquired ?-lactamases presents a particular challenge owing to some natural spectra that include virtually all ?-lactam classes. Glycopeptide resistance has been largely restricted to nosocomial Enterococcus faecium strains, the spread of which is promoted by ineffective infection control mechanisms for fecal organisms and the widespread use of colonization-promoting antimicrobials (especially cephalosporins and antianaerobic antibiotics). Fluoroquinolone resistance in community-associated strains of Escherichia coli, many of which also express ?-lactamases that confer cephalosporin resistance, is increasingly prevalent. Economic and regulatory forces have served to discourage large pharmaceutical companies from developing new antibiotics, suggesting that the antibiotics currently on the market may be all that will be available for the coming decade. As such, it is critical that we devise, test, and implement antimicrobial stewardship strategies that are effective at constraining and, ideally, reducing resistance in human pathogenic bacteria.},

Acidic and basic ion-exchange resins were physically separated into individual sacks ("tea bags") for trapping basic and acidic compounds, respectively, leaving behind in solution neutral components of the natural mixtures. Trapped compounds were then recovered from solid phase by appropriate suspension in acidic or basic solutions. The feasibility of the proposed separation protocol was demonstrated and optimized with an "artificial mixture" of model compounds. In addition, the utility of this methodology was illustrated with the successful separation of the alkaloid skytanthine from Skytanthus acutus Meyen and the main catechins and caffeine from Camellia sinensis L. (Kuntze). This novel approach offers multiple advantages over traditional extraction methods, as it is not labor intensive, makes use of only small quantities of solvents, produces fractions in adequate quantities for biological assays, and can be easily adapted to field conditions for bioprospecting activities.},

abstract = {Octanol–water partition coefficients are the most widely used measure of lipophilicity in modelling biological partition/distribution. It has long been recognised that the retention of a compound in reversed-phase liquid chromatography is governed by its lipophilicity/hydrophobicity, and thus shows correlation with an octanol–water partition coefficient. A great number of publications have reported the efforts made to adjust HPLC conditions to measure surrogate octanol–water partition coefficients. However, there is no general consensus in this field. HPLC provides a platform to measure various types of lipophilicity that can provide relevant information about the compounds' property. In this way HPLC can be more valuable than just a surrogate for octanol–water partition. Chromatography using biomimetic stationary phases may provide better insight for biological partition/distribution processes. The research in this field is still ongoing and a large variety of HPLC conditions have been suggested. This review will outline approaches to overcoming the difficulties of standardisation and describe different theoretical approaches for comparison of HPLC lipophilicity data obtained under various conditions, along with the relation of these results to biological partition/distribution.},

abstract = {The biosynthesis of the aromatic carotene isorenieratene is restricted to green photosynthetic bacteria and a few actinomycetes. Among them Streptomyces griseus has been used to study the genes involved in this pathway. Five genes out of seven of two adjacent operons in one cluster could be identified to be sufficient for the synthesis of isorenieratene. Stepwise deletions of these genes demonstrated their participation in phytoene synthesis, phytoene desaturation and lycopene cyclization. The novel gene crtU was assigned to encode a unique desaturase responsible for the conversion of $\beta$-carotene via $\beta$-isorenieratene to isorenieratene by a desaturation/methyltransferation mechanism. Sequence analysis of crtU revealed two conserved regions, one at the N-terminus and the other at the C-terminus of the protein which is universal to different types of carotene desaturases. In addition, the sequence comprises a motif typically found in methyltransferases. The deletion of the two remaining genes of the cluster left the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway unaffected.},

abstract = {This work aims at characterizing interactions between a select set of probes and 22 hydrophilic and polar commercial stationary phases, to develop an understanding of the relationship between the chemical properties of those phases and their interplay with the eluent and solutes in hydrophilic interaction chromatography. " Hydrophilic interaction" is a somewhat inexact term, and an attempt was therefore made to characterize the interactions involved in HILIC as hydrophilic, hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole, $\pi$-$\pi$ interaction, and shape-selectivity. Each specific interaction was quantified from the separation factors of a pair of similar substances of which one had properties promoting the interaction mode being probed while the other did not. The effects of particle size and pore size of the phases on retention and selectivity were also studied. The phases investigated covered a wide range of surface functional groups including zwitterionic (sulfobetaine and phosphocholine), neutral (amide and hydroxyl), cationic (amine), and anionic (sulfonic acid and silanol). Principal component analysis of the data showed that partitioning was a dominating mechanism for uncharged solutes in HILIC. However, correlations between functional groups and interactions were also observed, which confirms that the HILIC retention mechanism is partly contributed by adsorption mechanisms involving electrostatic interaction and multipoint hydrogen bonding. Phases with smaller pore diameters yielded longer retention of solutes, but did not significantly change the column selectivities. The particle diameter had no significant effect, neither on retention, nor on the selectivities. An increased water content in the eluent reduced the multipoint hydrogen bonding interactions, while an increased electrolyte concentration lowered the selectivities of the tested columns and made their interaction patterns more similar. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

The DNA cleaving properties of C-1027 are compared with those of other enediyne compounds such as neocarzinostatin, esperamicin A1, and calicheamicin gamma 1. Even in the absence of thiols or reductants, the antibiotic C-1027 has high DNA breakage ability. Of special interest is the fact that C-1027 causes strand breaks two base pairs apart at specific sites such as 5'-TAT/3'-ATA and 5'-AGA/3'-TCT (cleavage sites in italics) in the two strands. This novel double-stranded cleavage fashion is different from that of calicheamicin gamma 1, which is found to have a 3-bp separation between cleavage sites on the two strands. The asymmetric cleavage pattern to the 3'-side and a competitive experiment with distamycin A reveal minor-groove interaction of double-helical DNA with C-1027. This antibiotic appears to oxidize DNA through hydrogen abstraction predominantly at the C-4' carbon of deoxyribose. The activation mechanism of C-1027, which contains an enediyne chromophore of the esperamicin/calicheamicin type, has been proposed.},

These compounds, named enediynes, are among the most effective chemotherapeutic agents known. Often compared with intelligent weapons, due to the unique structure and sophisticated mechanism by which they destroy double-helical DNA, enediyne antibiotics are nowadays the most promising leaders in the anticancer therapy. Apart from their diversity, enediyne compounds share some structural and functional similarities. One fragment of a structure is responsible for the recognition and transport, another part acts as molecular trigger while the third, reactive enediyne unit, undergoes Bergman cycloaromatization and causes DNA breakage. Members of the enediyne family are already in clinical use to treat various cancers, but more general use is limited by their complex structure, which makes them formidable targets for synthetic chemists. There are three main approaches in the design of new enediyne-related compounds: improvement of enediyne {\textgreater}warheads{\textless}, increasing the selectivity and control of chemical or photo-induced activation.

The calibration routine was demonstrated to improve the quality of quantitative estimates and purity estimates given by the gradient HPLC-ELSD. The average error in quantitation for the series of materials was 8.3{\%}.},

abstract = {Novel chiral stationary phases (CSPs) based on zwitterionic Cinchona alkaloid-type low-molecular mass chiral selectors (SOs), as they have been reported recently, were investigated in HPLC towards effects on their chromatographic behavior by mobile phase composition. Mobile phase characteristics like acid-to-base ratio and type of acidic and basic additives as well as effect of type of bulk solvents in nonaqueous polar organic and aqueous reversed-phase (RP) eluent systems were varied in order to illustrate the variability and applicability of zwitterionic CSPs with regard to mobile phase aspects. Chiral SOs of the five zwitterionic CSPs investigated herein contained weak and strong cation-exchange (WCX, SCX) sites at C9- and C6′-positions of the Cinchona alkaloid scaffold which itself accommodated the weak anion-exchange (WAX) site. The study focused on zwitterion-exchange (ZX) operational mode and chiral amino acids as target analytes. Besides, also the anion-exchange (AX) mode for chiral N-blocked amino acid analytes was considered, because of the intramolecular counterion (IMCI) property available in AX mode. Overall, most general and successful conditions in ZX mode were found to be weakly acidic methanolic mobile phases. In aqueous eluents RP contributions to retention came into play but only at low organic modifier content because of the highly polar character of zwitterionic analytes. At higher acetonitrile content, HILIC-related retention phenomena were observed. When using weakly basic eluent system in AX mode remarkably fast enantiomer separations involving exclusion phenomena were possible with one enantiomer eluting before and the other after void volume.},

abstract = {A screen for antifungal compounds from Lysobacter enzymogenes strain C3, a bacterial biological control agent of fungal diseases, has previously led to the isolation of heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF). HSAF exhibits inhibitory activities against a wide range of fungal species and shows a novel mode of antifungal action by disrupting the biosynthesis of a distinct group of sphingolipids. We have now determined the chemical structure of HSAF, which is identical to that of dihydromaltophilin, an antifungal metabolite with a unique macrocyclic lactam system containing a tetramic acid moiety and a 5,5,6-tricyclic skeleton. We have also identified the genetic locus responsible for the biosynthesis of HSAF in strain C3. DNA sequencing of this locus revealed genes for a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS), a sterol desaturase, a ferredoxin reductase, and an arginase. The disruption of the PKS-NRPS gene generated C3 mutants that lost the ability to produce HSAF and to inhibit fungal growth, demonstrating a hybrid PKS-NRPS that catalyzed the biosynthesis of the unique macrolactam system that is found in many biologically active natural products isolated from marine organisms. In addition, we have generated mutants with disrupted sterol desaturase, ferredoxin reductase, and arginase and examined the metabolites produced in these mutants. The work represents the first study of the genetic basis for the biosynthesis of the tetramic acid-containing macrolactams. The elucidation of the chemical structure of HSAF and the identification of the genetic locus for its biosynthesis establish the foundation for future exploitation of this group of compounds as new fungicides or antifungal drugs.},

abstract = {We report a new web server, aLeaves (http://aleaves.cdb.riken.jp/), for homologue collection from diverse animal genomes. In molecular comparative studies involving multiple species, orthology identification is the basis on which most subsequent biological analyses rely. It can be achieved most accurately by explicit phylogenetic inference. More and more species are subjected to large-scale sequencing, but the resultant resources are scattered in independent project-based, and multi-species, but separate, web sites. This complicates data access and is becoming a serious barrier to the comprehensiveness of molecular phylogenetic analysis. aLeaves, launched to overcome this difficulty, collects sequences similar to an input query sequence from various data sources. The collected sequences can be passed on to the MAFFT sequence alignment server (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/), which has been significantly improved in interactivity. This update enables to switch between (i) sequence selection using the Archaeopteryx tree viewer, (ii) multiple sequence alignment and (iii) tree inference. This can be performed as a loop until one reaches a sensible data set, which minimizes redundancy for better visibility and handling in phylogenetic inference while covering relevant taxa. The work flow achieved by the seamless link between aLeaves and MAFFT provides a convenient online platform to address various questions in zoology and evolutionary biology.},

@article{Strege,
abstract = {For the drug discovery efforts currently taking place within the pharmaceutical industry, natural product extracts have been found to provide a valuable source of molecular diversity which is complementary to that provided by traditional synthetic organic methods or combinatorial chemistry. However, there exists a need for analytical tools that can facilitate the separation and characterization of components from these sources in a rapid manner. Specifically, the evaluation of highly polar compounds (i.e., compounds that cannot be retained on traditional reversed-phase stationary phases) has been challenging, and a hydrophilic interaction chromatography-electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry (HILIC-ESI-MS) method was developed to meet this need. In this inves-tigation, amide-, Polyhydroxyethyl Aspartamide-, and cy-clodextrin-based packings provided superior performance for the analysis of a set of polar natural product com-pounds. The properties of the mobile-phase buffers also greatly impacted the separations, and relative to other volatile buffering agents, ammonium acetate at a concen-tration of approximately 6.5 mM was determined to facilitate optimal HILIC retention, reproducibility, and durability. An optimized HILIC-ESI-MS system was successfully applied for the analysis of complex natural product mixtures. The techniques described in this report should also prove useful for the analysis of polar compounds from synthetic sources of molecular diversity such as combinatorial chemistry. Within the pharmaceutical industry, the identification of novel active compounds through the use of high-throughput screening (HTS) can be considered to be one of the most important functions for success. The chemical diversity of the collection of samples that undergo HTS is crucial, and vast libraries consisting of thousands of compounds generated by biological (e.g., natural products) or synthetic methods (e.g., combinatorial chemistry) are being created to provide this diversity. Samples isolated for these libraries often are initially generated as complex mixtures consisting of multiple components, and powerful analysis tools are required for both the separation and characterization of the compounds in these mixtures in a rapid manner, either prior to or following HTS. Specifically, the intrinsic complexity of natural product extracts represents both a source of extremely high compound diversity and a significant separation/deconvolution challenge. Traditionally, reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) has served as an effective technique for the separation of many of the components in complex mixtures that are under evaluation for drug discovery. Reversed-phase column packings have been successfully utilized in conjunction with volatile mobile phases to provide rapid high-throughput characterization of samples via liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). However, a significant portion of chemical diver-sity lacks the hydrophobic character necessary for suitable retention on an octadecyl (C18) reversed-phase packing and, therefore, requires alternative methods for analysis. Because of the difficulties associated with their high-throughput processing, including the fact that most natural product fermentation media components behave similarly, these " polar compounds " are often not pursued as viable drug candidates at the HTS stage. If a durable, rapid, and simple separation and analysis system could be designed for the high-throughput evaluation of polar com-pounds from natural product, combinatorial chemistry, or other sources, the post-HTS characterization (including the determina-tion of novel structures and the identification of known com-pounds) of samples of this nature could be effectively integrated within drug discovery programs. Normal-phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) has historically been employed for separations using nonaqueous mobile phases such as hexane or chloroform together with silica or alumina stationary phases. However, the application of NPLC to the separation of samples of biological origin has been extremely limited because of the problems associated with dissolving hydrophilic materials in nonaqueous mobile phases. Another difficulty associated with the use of NPLC for complex mixture characterization is the fact that several commonly used organic solvents such as benzene and toluene are not compatible with the electrospray process now prevalently utilized for molecular mass determinations. 1 NPLC using mobile phases containing a low percentage of an aqueous component has been employed, but the chromatography obtained in these systems has been of notoriously poor reproducibility. 2},

HILIC can be used as a valuable alternative LC mode for separating small polar compounds. Polar samples usually show good solubility in the mobile phase containing some water used in HILIC, which overcomes the drawbacks of the poor solubility often encountered in normal phase LC. HILIC is suitable for analyzing compounds in complex systems that elute near the void in reversed-phase chromatography. Ion-pair reagents are not required in HILIC which makes it convenient to couple with MS hence its increased popularity in recent years. In this review, the retention mechanism in HILIC is briefly discussed and a list of important applications is provided including main experimental conditions and a brief summary of the results. The references provide a comprehensive overview and insight into the application of HILIC in antibiotics analysis. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

These efforts revealed considerable metabolite diversity and led to several molecular family-gene cluster pairings, of which the quinomycin-type depsipeptide retimycin A was characterized and linked to gene cluster NRPS40 using pattern-based bioinformatic approaches.},

@article{Minkels1985,
abstract = {Introduction Throughout the scientific literature on protein research of the last thirty years, the $\alpha$-helix dipole is mentioned in a number of cases where its partial charge on both the C-terminal and the N-terminal ends is thought to be involved in various biological processes on a molecular level. In order to understand the cause of this dipole moment, one must look at the structure and the geometry of the $\alpha$-helix. The $\alpha$-helix is a right handed coiled structure. Each amino acid makes a turn of about 100 degrees and hence it requires 3.6 residues to make a full turn. Amino acids that wind around the axis form hydrogen bounds with each other. The N-H group of each amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with the C=O of the amino acid that is located four places earlier in the helix. The vast number of hydrogen bonds that is formed is actually the underlying reason for the forming of this secondary protein structure. Although the principles behind the occurrence of the helix dipole have been described earlier, its role in protein structure and function was first reviewed by Hol in 1985. He states that the helix dipole originates in the dipole of the individual peptide unit. The charge distribution within such a unit is pictured in Figure 1. Its direction is parallel to the N-H and C=O bonds. It has been shown that in an $\alpha$-helix around 97{\%} of all peptide dipole moments point in the direction of the helix axis, the dipole is therefore quite insensitive to the $\phi$ and $\psi$ angles. The C=O groups are in a slightly upward direction (toward the C-terminus) and the N-H groups are in a downward direction (toward the N-terminus) and this gives rise to a small dipole. The aggregate effect of all individual dipoles in an $\alpha$-helix is a negative dipole moment at the C-terminal end, and a positive dipole moment at the N-terminal end of the helix. The dipole moment of an individual peptide unit is about 3,46 D which equals 0,72 e {\AA} or 0,5 e per 1,5 {\AA}. Since the axial shift per residue in an $\alpha$-helix is also 1,5 {\AA}, all dipoles cancel out except for the C-and N-terminal ones. However, a dipole moment is also affected by the local environment and especially hydrogen bonds are known to increase the value of dipole moments. Both calculations and experimental measurements confirm that the dipole moment is indeed increased, by 25 to 50{\%}. Although the amount of known protein structures and biological mechanisms has enormously expanded since then, Hol already distinguished a few roles for the helix dipole in proteins that still prove to be relevant. In his review he discusses the role of the helix dipole in glutathione peroxidase, rhodanese, subtilisin, triose phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin and papain. In these proteins, the helix dipole is used for binding stabilizing (intermediary) charges varying from anions to active site residues. Hol also analyzed twenty proteins that were known to bind phosphate groups. The majority of these proteins combined the N-terminal dipole and positively charged residues for this, although a few proteins such as flavodoxin depended solely on a helix dipole and neighbouring N-H groups for phosphate binding. It was found that the phosphate binding helices were often part of a $\beta$$\alpha$$\beta$-motif. However, the individual amino acid sequences mostly differed, except for a highly conserved glycine that was incorporated to provide space for the approaching phosphate moiety. Hol thus concluded that the electrostatic interactions, and not a specific sequence, was essential to the phosphate binding mechanism. Further research aimed to analyze if the binding by these anions was due to the possibility of forming large amounts of hydrogen bonds concluded this was not the case, thereby confirming his conclusion. At the time no Figure 1: Peptide charge distribution, numbers in units of the elementary charge [8] proteins were known that applied a similar mechanism to DNA or RNA binding. Hol further concluded in his review that the $\alpha$-helix dipole may explain the most frequently observed folding patterns in proteins. He also included the dipole of parallel $\beta$-strands in his model, but further research proved this dipole to be non-existent. His conclusions in summary: (i) In all-helical proteins, helices tend to be anti-parallel because of a favourable interaction between alpha-helix dipoles. This also explains the frequent occurrence of alpha-alpha-units; (ii) In $\alpha$$\beta$-proteins, a favourable interaction occurs between the $\beta$ -dipoles in the center of the molecule and the $\alpha$-helix dipoles arranged in an anti-parallel way around the parallel beta-strands. Such an interaction would also explain the stability of the $\beta$$\alpha$$\beta$ -unit; (iii) In all-$\beta$ proteins the favourable $\alpha$$\beta$-dipole interactions are absent and $\beta$-strands tend to be anti-parallel as an unfavourable interaction between parallel $\beta$-dipoles would otherwise occur. Finally, Hol performed calculations on the interaction between two $\alpha$-helices in vacuum and concluded that the most important parameters are the helix length, the distance between the two helices and the $\Omega$-angle. These parameters are pictured in Figure 2. Hol recognized four different related environments: bulk water, bulk protein, the outer protein surface and the proteins first hydration shell. Due to different mobilities and dielectric properties Hol rightfully concluded that exact calculations on interactions in proteins aren't straightforward as no dielectric constant can be applied. We will see whether Hol was right in stating that " the $\alpha$-helix dipole plays an important role in modulating the properties of several enzymes and in defining the mode of coenzyme binding by numerous proteins " .

abstract = {We determined the complete genome sequence of Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350, a soil bacterium producing an antituberculosis agent, streptomycin, which is the first aminoglycoside antibiotic, discovered more than 60 years ago. The linear chromosome consists of 8,545,929 base pairs (bp), with an average G+C content of 72.2{\%}, predicting 7,138 open reading frames, six rRNA operons (16S-23S-5S), and 66 tRNA genes. It contains extremely long terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of 132,910 bp each. The telomere's nucleotide sequence and secondary structure, consisting of several palindromes with a loop sequence of 5′-GGA-3′, are different from those of typical telomeres conserved among other Streptomyces species. In accordance with the difference, the chromosome has pseudogenes for a conserved terminal protein (Tpg) and a telomere-associated protein (Tap), and a novel pair of Tpg and Tap proteins is instead encoded by the TIRs. Comparisons with the genomes of two related species, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and Streptomyces avermitilis, clarified not only the characteristics of the S. griseus genome but also the existence of 24 Streptomyces-specific proteins. The S. griseus genome contains 34 gene clusters or genes for the biosynthesis of known or unknown secondary metabolites. Transcriptome analysis using a DNA microarray showed that at least four of these clusters, in addition to the streptomycin biosynthesis gene cluster, were activated directly or indirectly by AdpA, which is a central transcriptional activator for secondary metabolism and morphogenesis in the A-factor (a $\gamma$-butyrolactone signaling molecule) regulatory cascade in S. griseus.},

abstract = {A combination of small molecule chemistry, biosynthetic analysis, and genome mining has revealed the unexpected conservation of polycyclic tetramate macrolactam biosynthetic loci in diverse bacteria. Initially our chemical analysis of a Streptomyces strain associated with the southern pine beetle led to the discovery of frontalamides A and B, two previously undescribed members of this antibiotic family. Genome analyses and genetic manipulation of the producing organism led to the identification of the frontalamide biosynthetic gene cluster and several biosynthetic intermediates. The biosynthetic locus for the frontalamides' mixed polyketide/amino acid structure encodes a hybrid polyketide synthase nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS), which resembles iterative enzymes known in fungi. No such mixed iterative PKS-NRPS enzymes have been characterized in bacteria. Genome-mining efforts revealed strikingly conserved frontalamide-like biosynthetic clusters in the genomes of phylogenetically diverse bacteria ranging from proteobacteria to actinomycetes. Screens for environmental actinomycete isolates carrying frontalamide-like biosynthetic loci led to the isolation of a number of positive strains, the majority of which produced candidate frontalamide-like compounds under suitable growth conditions. These results establish the prevalence of frontalamide-like gene clusters in diverse bacterial types, with medicinally important Streptomyces species being particularly enriched.},

Successful dereplication with molecular networks requires MS/MS spectra of the natural product mixture along with MS/MS spectra of known standards, synthetic compounds, or well-characterized organisms, preferably organized into robust databases. This approach can accommodate different ionization platforms, enabling cross correlations of MS/MS data from ambient ionization, direct infusion, and LC-based methods. Molecular networking not only dereplicates known molecules from complex mixtures, it also captures related analogues, a challenge for many other dereplication strategies. To illustrate its utility as a dereplication tool, we apply mass spectrometry-based molecular networking to a diverse array of marine and terrestrial microbial samples, illustrating the dereplication of 58 molecules including analogues.},

abstract = {The concept of recently introduced Cinchona alkaloid-type zwitterionic chiral stationary phases (CSPs) is based on fusing key cation- and anion-exchange (CX, AX) moieties in one single low-molecular mass chiral selector (SO) with the resulting CSPs allowing enantiomer separations of a wide range of chiral ionizable analytes comprising acids, bases, and zwitterionic compounds. Herein, we report principal, systematic investigations of the ion-exchange-type retention mechanisms available with the novel zwitterionic CSPs in nonaqueous polar organic mode. Typical CX and AX processes, corresponding to the parent single ion exchangers, are confirmed also for zwitterionic CSPs. Also the mechanism leading to recognition and retention of zwitterions was found to be ion exchange mediated in a zwitterion-exchange (ZX) mode. In both AX and CX modes the additional ionizable group within the SO besides the site responsible for the respective ion-exchange process could be characterized as an intramolecular counterion (IMCI) that effectively participates in the ion-exchange equilibria and thus, contributes to solute elution. In the ZX mode both oppositely charged groups of the zwitterionic SO were found not only to be the sites for simultaneous ion pairing with the analyte but also functioned as IMCIs at the same time. The main practical consequences of the IMCI feature were significant reduction of the amounts and even elimination of acidic and basic additives required in the eluent systems to afford analyte elution while still providing faster analysis than the parent single ion-exchanger-type CSPs. The set of ten structurally different zwitterionic CSPs employed in this study facilitated the establishment of correlations between chromatographic behavior of the CSPs with particular SO elements, thereby supporting the understanding of the working principles of these novel packing materials on a molecular level.},

abstract = {Characterization of the secondary structure of the antitumor antibiotic C-1027 has been made from a comparison of C-1027 and its apoprotein by various analytical means. The results indicated the antibiotic to be abundant in beta-structure by measurements of Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum, and by a prediction of the secondary structure based on the amino acid sequence of the peptide. In comparison of the IR spectra of their proteins in D2O, the apoprotein exhibited a faster H-D exchange than C-1027, indicating an increase in the ''non-motile parts'' of the beta-sheets formed through the protein-chromophore interaction in holo-C-1027. The prediction of hydropathic index indicated the hydrophobic residues of the apoprotein to be predominantly located in the beta-sheet structures, suggesting hydrophobic interaction in the binding between chromophore and apoprotein. Further, the interaction between chromophore and apoprotein was detected by a fluorescence method. The result showed the dissociation constant (Kd) to be 6.88 x 10(-5) M, indicating that the chromophore is tightly bound to the protein moiety.},

This showed a great potential for using ion-exchange chromatography as an integral part of the separation procedure, orthogonal to the classic reversed-phase strategy. Thus, we investigated the use of an "explorative solid-phase extraction" (E-SPE) protocol using SAX, Oasis MAX, SCX, and LH-20 columns for targeted exploitation of chemical functionalities. E-SPE provides a minimum of fractions (15) for chemical and biological analyses and implicates development into a preparative scale methodology. Overall, this allows fast extract prioritization, easier dereplication, mapping of biological activities, and formulation of a purification strategy.},

To further characterize this gene cluster, we use the same synthetic biology approach to create a series of gene deletion constructs and elucidate the biosynthetic steps for the formation of the polycyclic system. The strategy we employ bypasses the traditional laborious processes to elicit gene cluster expression and should be generally applicable to many other silent or cryptic gene clusters for discovery and characterization of new natural products. },

abstract = {The amf gene cluster was previously identified as a regulator for the onset of aerial-mycelium formation in Streptomyces griseus. The nucleotide sequences of amf and its counterparts in other species revealed a conserved gene organization consisting of five open reading frames. A nonsense mutation in amfS, encoding a 43-amino-acid peptide, caused significant blocking of aerial-mycelium formation and streptomycin production, suggesting its role as a regulatory molecule. Extracellular-complementation tests for the aerial-mycelium-deficient phenotype of the amfS mutant demonstrated that AmfS was secreted by the wild-type strain. A null mutation in amfBA, encoding HlyB-like membrane translocators, abolished the extracellular AmfS activity without affecting the wild-type morphology, which suggests that AmfBA is involved not in production but in export of AmfS. A synthetic C-terminal octapeptide partially induced aerial-mycelium formation in the amfS mutant, which suggests that an AmfS derivative, but not AmfS itself, serves as an extracellular morphogen.},

We demonstrate here that molecular networking, an approach that organizes MS/MS data based on chemical similarity, is a powerful complement to traditional dereplication strategies. Successful dereplication with molecular networks requires MS/MS spectra of the natural product mixture along with MS/MS spectra of known standards, synthetic compounds, or well-characterized organisms, preferably organized into robust databases. This approach can accommodate different ionization platforms, enabling cross correlations of MS/MS data from ambient ionization, direct infusion, and LC-based methods. Molecular networking not only dereplicates known molecules from complex mixtures, it also captures related analogues, a challenge for many other dereplication strategies.

abstract = {Mutants of Streptomyces griseus deficient in A-factor production are sporulation negative, since A-factor is an essential hormonal regulator for the induction of morphological and physiological differentiation in this bacterium. A DNA fragment which induced aerial mycelium formation and sporulation in an A-factor-deficient mutant strain, S. griseus HH1, was cloned from this mutant strain. Subcloning experiments and nucleotide sequencing showed that two open reading frames, ORF1 with 656 amino acids and ORF2 with 201 amino acids, were required in order to induce sporulation. The amino acid sequence of ORF1 significantly resembled that of the Escherichia coli HlyB protein, a member of a family of bacterial membrane proteins engaged in ATP-dependent secretion mechanisms. Conserved features of this surface translocator family, such as the transmembrane structure predicted by their hydropathy profiles and the amino acid sequence forming an ATP-binding fold, were also conserved in ORF1. The ORF1 gene appeared to constitute a transcriptional unit with an additional upstream gene encoding ORF3, which was greatly similar to ORF1 in size and amino acid sequence. The other protein, ORF2, showed significant end-to-end homology with the E. coli uhpA product, a regulatory protein for the uptake of sugar phosphates. Like UhpA as a response regulator of a bacterial two-component regulatory system, ORF2 contained a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain at its COOH-terminal portion and an Asp residue (Asp-54) probably to be phosphorylated at its NH2-terminal portion. An amino acid replacement from Asp-54 to Asn resulted in the loss of the ability of ORF2 to induce sporulation in strain HH1.},

abstract = {This work aims at characterizing interactions between a select set of probes and 22 hydrophilic and polar commercial stationary phases, to develop an understanding of the relationship between the chemical properties of those phases and their interplay with the eluent and solutes in hydrophilic interaction chromatography. " Hydrophilic interaction" is a somewhat inexact term, and an attempt was therefore made to characterize the interactions involved in HILIC as hydrophilic, hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole, $\pi$-$\pi$ interaction, and shape-selectivity. Each specific interaction was quantified from the separation factors of a pair of similar substances of which one had properties promoting the interaction mode being probed while the other did not. The effects of particle size and pore size of the phases on retention and selectivity were also studied. The phases investigated covered a wide range of surface functional groups including zwitterionic (sulfobetaine and phosphocholine), neutral (amide and hydroxyl), cationic (amine), and anionic (sulfonic acid and silanol). Principal component analysis of the data showed that partitioning was a dominating mechanism for uncharged solutes in HILIC. However, correlations between functional groups and interactions were also observed, which confirms that the HILIC retention mechanism is partly contributed by adsorption mechanisms involving electrostatic interaction and multipoint hydrogen bonding. Phases with smaller pore diameters yielded longer retention of solutes, but did not significantly change the column selectivities. The particle diameter had no significant effect, neither on retention, nor on the selectivities. An increased water content in the eluent reduced the multipoint hydrogen bonding interactions, while an increased electrolyte concentration lowered the selectivities of the tested columns and made their interaction patterns more similar. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Shaking bioreactors are the most frequently used reaction vessels in biotechnology and have been so for many decades. In spite of their large practical importance, very little is known about the characteristic properties of shaken cultures from an engineering point of view. The few publications available contain to some extent contradicting statements and conflicting advice concerning the correct operating conditions of shaking bioreactors. Depending on the investigated microbial system, the engineering parameters may more or less significantly influence the experimental results in a quantitative as well as in a qualitative manner. Unfortunately, these kind of interactions are often overlooked or ignored by scientists. Precise knowledge about the controlling hydrodynamic phenomena in shaking bioreactors and quantitative information about the physical parameters influencing the cultures are needed to assure reproducible and meaningful operating conditions. In this introduction, the state of the art of culturing microorganisms in shaking bioreactors is reviewed and some issues of their practical application in screening and process development projects are addressed. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The identification of chemical structures in natural product mixtures is an important task in drug discovery but is still a challenging problem, as structural elucidation is a time-consuming process and is limited by the available mass spectra of known natural products. Computer-aided structure elucidation (CASE) strategies seek to automatically propose a list of possible chemical structures in mixtures by utilizing chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. However, current CASE tools still cannot automatically solve structures for experienced natural product chemists. Here, we formulated the structural elucidation of natural products in a mixture as a computational problem by extending a list of scaffolds using a weighted side chain list after analyzing a collection of 243,130 natural products and designed an efficient algorithm to precisely identify the chemical structures. The complexity of such a problem is NP-complete. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm can solve this NP-complete problem in pseudo-polynomial time after converting floating point molecular weights into integers. However, the running time of the DP algorithm degrades exponentially as the precision of the mass spectrometry experiment grows. To ideally solve in polynomial time, we proposed a novel iterative DP algorithm that can quickly recognize the chemical structures of natural products. By utilizing this algorithm to elucidate the structures of four natural products that were experimentally and structurally determined, the algorithm can search the exact solutions, and the time performance was shown to be in polynomial time for average cases. The proposed method improved the speed of the structural elucidation of natural products and helped broaden the spectrum of available compounds that could be applied as new drug candidates. A web service built for structural elucidation studies is freely accessible via the following link ( http://csccp.cmdm.tw/ ).},

abstract = {Temperate viruses can become dormant in their host cells, a process called lysogeny. In every infection, such viruses decide between the lytic and the lysogenic cycles, that is, whether to replicate and lyse their host or to lysogenize and keep the host viable. Here we show that viruses (phages) of the SPbeta group use a small-molecule communication system to coordinate lysis–lysogeny decisions. During infection of its Bacillus host cell, the phage produces a six amino-acids-long communication peptide that is released into the medium. In subsequent infections, progeny phages measure the concentration of this peptide and lysogenize if the concentration is sufficiently high. We found that different phages encode different versions of the communication peptide, demonstrating a phage-specific peptide communication code for lysogeny decisions. We term this communication system the ‘arbitrium' system, and further show that it is encoded by three phage genes: aimP, which produces the peptide; aimR, the intracellular peptide receptor; and aimX, a negative regulator of lysogeny. The arbitrium system enables a descendant phage to ‘communicate' with its predecessors, that is, to estimate the amount of recent previous infections and hence decide whether to employ the lytic or lysogenic cycle.},

The model of the apoprotein-chromophore complex also suggests the most probable stereochemistry of the chromophore (8R,9S,13R,17R), specific interactions between Apo-C1027 and C1027-Chr, and the origin of the stabilization of the chromophore by the apoprotein. The acetylenic bond of C1027-Chr appears to be stabilized by (1) hydrophobic interactions with the bottom of the pocket of Apo-C1027, (2) orbital interaction with Cys36-Cys45 disulfide bond, (3) van der Waals contact with Pro76, and (4) pi-pi stacking with the benzene moiety of the chromophore. In this model, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the chromophore indicates that the acetylene bond distance (C2-C7) of the apoprotein-bound chromophore is longer than that of the unbound chromophore.},

The reporter cells mainly represent novel antibiotic biosensors compatible with high-throughput screening. We validated the strains by developing screens with a set of 14,000 pure natural products, representing a source of highly diverse chemical entities, many of them with antibiotic activity (6{\%} with anti-Bacillus subtilis activity of {\textless}/=25 mug/ml]).
