abstract = {The enediynes, unified by their unique molecular architecture and mode of action, represent some of the most potent anticancer drugs ever discovered. The biosynthesis of the enediyne core has been predicted to be initiated by a polyketide synthase (PKS) that is distinct from all known PKSs. Characterization of the enediyne PKS involved in C-1027 (SgcE) and neocarzinostatin (NcsE) biosynthesis has now revealed that (i) the PKSs contain a central acyl carrier protein domain and C-terminal phosphopantetheinyl transferase domain; (ii) the PKSs are functional in heterologous hosts, and coexpression with an enediyne thioesterase gene produces the first isolable compound, 1,3,5,7,9,11,13-pentadecaheptaene, in enediyne core biosynthesis; and (iii) the findings for SgcE and NcsE are likely shared among all nine-membered enediynes, thereby supporting a common mechanism to initiate enediyne biosynthesis.},

@article{Erez2017,
abstract = {Temperate viruses can become dormant in their host cells, a process called lysogeny. In every infection, such viruses decide between the lytic and the lysogenic cycles, that is, whether to replicate and lyse their host or to lysogenize and keep the host viable. Here we show that viruses (phages) of the SPbeta group use a small-molecule communication system to coordinate lysis–lysogeny decisions. During infection of its Bacillus host cell, the phage produces a six amino-acids-long communication peptide that is released into the medium. In subsequent infections, progeny phages measure the concentration of this peptide and lysogenize if the concentration is sufficiently high. We found that different phages encode different versions of the communication peptide, demonstrating a phage-specific peptide communication code for lysogeny decisions. We term this communication system the ‘arbitrium' system, and further show that it is encoded by three phage genes: aimP, which produces the peptide; aimR, the intracellular peptide receptor; and aimX, a negative regulator of lysogeny. The arbitrium system enables a descendant phage to ‘communicate' with its predecessors, that is, to estimate the amount of recent previous infections and hence decide whether to employ the lytic or lysogenic cycle.},

@article{Gredicak2007,
abstract = {Scientists of all kinds have long been intrigued by the nature, action and potential of natural toxins that possess exceptional antibacterial and anticancer activities. These compounds, named enediynes, are among the most effective chemotherapeutic agents known. Often compared with intelligent weapons, due to the unique structure and sophisticated mechanism by which they destroy double-helical DNA, enediyne antibiotics are nowadays the most promising leaders in the anticancer therapy. Apart from their diversity, enediyne compounds share some structural and functional similarities. One fragment of a structure is responsible for the recognition and transport, another part acts as molecular trigger while the third, reactive enediyne unit, undergoes Bergman cycloaromatization and causes DNA breakage. Members of the enediyne family are already in clinical use to treat various cancers, but more general use is limited by their complex structure, which makes them formidable targets for synthetic chemists. There are three main approaches in the design of new enediyne-related compounds: improvement of enediyne {\textgreater}warheads{\textless}, increasing the selectivity and control of chemical or photo-induced activation. This paper gives an overview of naturally occurring enediynes, their mode of action and efforts undertaken to design artificial enediyne-related DNA cleaving agents.},

abstract = {On the basis of the van der Waals and electrostatic potential energy calculations and energy minimization (EM), a model for the apoprotein-chromophore complex of C-1027 has been constructed by docking the apoprotein (Apo-C1027) and the chromophore (C1027-Chr). The model of the apoprotein-chromophore complex also suggests the most probable stereochemistry of the chromophore (8R,9S,13R,17R), specific interactions between Apo-C1027 and C1027-Chr, and the origin of the stabilization of the chromophore by the apoprotein. The acetylenic bond of C1027-Chr appears to be stabilized by (1) hydrophobic interactions with the bottom of the pocket of Apo-C1027, (2) orbital interaction with Cys36-Cys45 disulfide bond, (3) van der Waals contact with Pro76, and (4) pi-pi stacking with the benzene moiety of the chromophore. In this model, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the chromophore indicates that the acetylene bond distance (C2-C7) of the apoprotein-bound chromophore is longer than that of the unbound chromophore.},

abstract = {A new macromolecular antitumor antibiotic, C-1027, shows potent cytotoxic effects and DNA cutting activity. The DNA cleaving properties of C-1027 are compared with those of other enediyne compounds such as neocarzinostatin, esperamicin A1, and calicheamicin gamma 1. Even in the absence of thiols or reductants, the antibiotic C-1027 has high DNA breakage ability. Of special interest is the fact that C-1027 causes strand breaks two base pairs apart at specific sites such as 5'-TAT/3'-ATA and 5'-AGA/3'-TCT (cleavage sites in italics) in the two strands. This novel double-stranded cleavage fashion is different from that of calicheamicin gamma 1, which is found to have a 3-bp separation between cleavage sites on the two strands. The asymmetric cleavage pattern to the 3'-side and a competitive experiment with distamycin A reveal minor-groove interaction of double-helical DNA with C-1027. This antibiotic appears to oxidize DNA through hydrogen abstraction predominantly at the C-4' carbon of deoxyribose. The activation mechanism of C-1027, which contains an enediyne chromophore of the esperamicin/calicheamicin type, has been proposed.},

An increasing inventory of enediynes would benefit current application of ADCs in many oncology programs. Innovations in expanding the enediyne inventory should take advantage of the current knowledge of enediyne biosynthesis and post-genomics technologies. Bioinformatics analysis of microbial genomes reveals that enediynes are underexplored, in particular from Actinomycetales.

abstract = {Mutants of Streptomyces griseus deficient in A-factor production are sporulation negative, since A-factor is an essential hormonal regulator for the induction of morphological and physiological differentiation in this bacterium. A DNA fragment which induced aerial mycelium formation and sporulation in an A-factor-deficient mutant strain, S. griseus HH1, was cloned from this mutant strain. Subcloning experiments and nucleotide sequencing showed that two open reading frames, ORF1 with 656 amino acids and ORF2 with 201 amino acids, were required in order to induce sporulation. The amino acid sequence of ORF1 significantly resembled that of the Escherichia coli HlyB protein, a member of a family of bacterial membrane proteins engaged in ATP-dependent secretion mechanisms. Conserved features of this surface translocator family, such as the transmembrane structure predicted by their hydropathy profiles and the amino acid sequence forming an ATP-binding fold, were also conserved in ORF1. The ORF1 gene appeared to constitute a transcriptional unit with an additional upstream gene encoding ORF3, which was greatly similar to ORF1 in size and amino acid sequence. The other protein, ORF2, showed significant end-to-end homology with the E. coli uhpA product, a regulatory protein for the uptake of sugar phosphates. Like UhpA as a response regulator of a bacterial two-component regulatory system, ORF2 contained a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain at its COOH-terminal portion and an Asp residue (Asp-54) probably to be phosphorylated at its NH2-terminal portion. An amino acid replacement from Asp-54 to Asn resulted in the loss of the ability of ORF2 to induce sporulation in strain HH1.},

abstract = {Most small molecules are unable to rapidly traverse the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and accumulate inside these cells, making the discovery of much-needed drugs against these pathogens challenging. Current understanding of the physicochemical properties that dictate small-molecule accumulation in Gram-negative bacteria is largely based on retrospective analyses of antibacterial agents, which suggest that polarity and molecular weight are key factors. Here we assess the ability of over 180 diverse compounds to accumulate in Escherichia coli. Computational analysis of the results reveals major differences from the retrospective studies, namely that the small molecules that are most likely to accumulate contain an amine, are amphiphilic and rigid, and have low globularity. These guidelines were then applied to convert deoxynybomycin, a natural product that is active only against Gram-positive organisms, into an antibiotic with activity against a diverse panel of multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We anticipate that these findings will aid in the discovery and development of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria.},

abstract = {The amf gene cluster was previously identified as a regulator for the onset of aerial-mycelium formation in Streptomyces griseus. The nucleotide sequences of amf and its counterparts in other species revealed a conserved gene organization consisting of five open reading frames. A nonsense mutation in amfS, encoding a 43-amino-acid peptide, caused significant blocking of aerial-mycelium formation and streptomycin production, suggesting its role as a regulatory molecule. Extracellular-complementation tests for the aerial-mycelium-deficient phenotype of the amfS mutant demonstrated that AmfS was secreted by the wild-type strain. A null mutation in amfBA, encoding HlyB-like membrane translocators, abolished the extracellular AmfS activity without affecting the wild-type morphology, which suggests that AmfBA is involved not in production but in export of AmfS. A synthetic C-terminal octapeptide partially induced aerial-mycelium formation in the amfS mutant, which suggests that an AmfS derivative, but not AmfS itself, serves as an extracellular morphogen.},

@article{Nicolaou1993,
abstract = {Ever since the initial reports of the enediyne anticancer antibiotics in the late 1980s, researchers from a number of disciplines have been devoting increasing attention to their chemistry, biology, and potential medical applications. Synthetic chemists and molecular designers have been engaged in attempts to synthesize these molecules and to model their unique architecture. Considerable efforts have been directed at understanding and mimicking the various processes involved in the targeting, activation, and DNA cleavage associated with these natural products. This review summarizes the main contributions to the field, with particular emphasis on work from our laboratories. Highlights include studies of the Bergman reaction, which is central to the mechanism of action of enediynes, the design and chemical synthesis of a number of these systems, and biological studies with selected molecules. Finally, the total synthesis of calicheamicin gamma 1I, the most prominent member of this class of naturally occurring compounds, is discussed.},

abstract = {Characterization of the secondary structure of the antitumor antibiotic C-1027 has been made from a comparison of C-1027 and its apoprotein by various analytical means. The results indicated the antibiotic to be abundant in beta-structure by measurements of Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum, and by a prediction of the secondary structure based on the amino acid sequence of the peptide. In comparison of the IR spectra of their proteins in D2O, the apoprotein exhibited a faster H-D exchange than C-1027, indicating an increase in the ''non-motile parts'' of the beta-sheets formed through the protein-chromophore interaction in holo-C-1027. The prediction of hydropathic index indicated the hydrophobic residues of the apoprotein to be predominantly located in the beta-sheet structures, suggesting hydrophobic interaction in the binding between chromophore and apoprotein. Further, the interaction between chromophore and apoprotein was detected by a fluorescence method. The result showed the dissociation constant (Kd) to be 6.88 x 10(-5) M, indicating that the chromophore is tightly bound to the protein moiety.},

abstract = {This paper presents a general overview of the application of hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) in the analysis of antibiotics in different sample matrices including pharmaceutical, plasma, serum, fermentation broths, environmental water, animal origin, plant origin, etc. Specific applications of HILIC for analysis of aminoglycosides, ??-lactams, tetracyclines and other antibiotics are reviewed. HILIC can be used as a valuable alternative LC mode for separating small polar compounds. Polar samples usually show good solubility in the mobile phase containing some water used in HILIC, which overcomes the drawbacks of the poor solubility often encountered in normal phase LC. HILIC is suitable for analyzing compounds in complex systems that elute near the void in reversed-phase chromatography. Ion-pair reagents are not required in HILIC which makes it convenient to couple with MS hence its increased popularity in recent years. In this review, the retention mechanism in HILIC is briefly discussed and a list of important applications is provided including main experimental conditions and a brief summary of the results. The references provide a comprehensive overview and insight into the application of HILIC in antibiotics analysis. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cells containing reporters which are specifically induced via selected promoters are used in pharmaceutical drug discovery and in environmental biology. They are used in screening for novel drug candidates and in the detection of bioactive compounds in environmental samples. In this study, we generated and validated a set of five Bacillus subtilis promoters fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene suitable for cell-based screening, enabling the as yet most-comprehensive high-throughput diagnosis of antibiotic interference in the major biosynthetic pathways of bacteria: the biosynthesis of DNA by the yorB promoter, of RNA by the yvgS promoter, of proteins by the yheI promoter, of the cell wall by the ypuA promoter, and of fatty acids by the fabHB promoter. The reporter cells mainly represent novel antibiotic biosensors compatible with high-throughput screening. We validated the strains by developing screens with a set of 14,000 pure natural products, representing a source of highly diverse chemical entities, many of them with antibiotic activity (6{\%} with anti-Bacillus subtilis activity of {\textless}/=25 mug/ml]). Our screening approach is exemplified by the discovery of classical and novel DNA synthesis and translation inhibitors.
